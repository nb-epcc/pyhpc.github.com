The PyHPC organizers are committed to inclusivity and accessibility:

* We will endeavour to ensure all workshop committees are diverse and inclusive
* We will seek guidance on inclusivity and accessiblity best practices
* We will review all workshop communications and processes for fairness and implied biases
* We will promote the “Handshake” initiative: in the spirit of inclusivity, workshop attendees will be asked to encourage and support at least one colleague who would typically exclude themselves from participating in the workshop to consider otherwise
* We will provide guidance to speakers on how to make workshop talks / presentations accessible and inclusive
* We will publicise the workshop to groups and communities that may not be reached through the usual channels
* We will be mindful to support those with accessibility needs and those with family commitments
