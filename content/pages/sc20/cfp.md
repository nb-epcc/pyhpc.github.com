## Intoduction
The high-level programming language Python is well established with a large community in academia and industry. It is a general-purpose language adopted by many scientific applications. Examples are computational fluid dynamics, bio molecular simulation, machine learning, finance, or scientific visualization. Scientists, engineers, and educators use Python for data science, high-performance computing, and distributed computing. Traditionally, system administrators use Python for system management and automating administration tasks. Python is extremely easy to learn due to its very clean syntax and great readability. Therefore developers love Python as it facilitates writing sustainable and maintainable software systems. For the same reasons, Python is well suited for education at all levels.

The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners using Python in all aspects of high performance and scientific computing. The goal is to present Python applications from mathematics, science, and engineering, to discuss general topics regarding the use of Python, and to share experiences using Python in scientific computing education.

## Call for Submissions
We encourage authors to submit novel research on the broad use of Python in primarily HPC contexts. Please submit either a paper or lightning talk related to Python usage in any of the following
topics and application areas as well as on broader topics in business, science, technology, engineering, or education.

Areas include, but are not limited to:

* High-Performance Computing, Big Data, Machine learning, and Data Science with Python
* Hybrid programming and integration with other programming languages
* Python compared to other languages for HPC and Data Science
* Python for emerging computing paradigms (e.g., quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, Probabilistic and stochastic computing
* Interactivity and reproducibility in HPC using Python
* Performance analysis, profiling, and debugging
* Administration of large HPC systems
* Scientific and interactive visualization
* Problem solving environments and frameworks
* Diversity, inclusivity and education in HPC and scientific computing


## Call For Papers

We invite you to submit a paper with at least six (6) pages and up to ten (10) pages (including figures, tables and references) via the submission site:

[% important_link url="#" text="Submit Paper" %]

All accepted papers will be published in the IEEE TCHPC Proceedings. The formatting instructions are available at the [IEEE website](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html). You can also use the template online on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-demo-template-for-computer-society-conferences/hzzszpqfkqky).

Authors will be able to provide up to one (1) additional pages for the Artifact Description (AD) appendix and, after paper acceptance, up to two (2) additional pages for the Artifact Evaluation (AE) appendix

Please keep accessiblity in mind when preparing your paper, for example when creating graphs and images. See our [accessibility guidance](/accessibility).

## Call for Lightning Talks
We invite you to submit a one-page application for a five-minute presentation to:
