In order for the workshop to be accessible to everyone, we ask that you follow these guidelines when submitting your paper or lightning talk:

 * allow for non-native English speakers by using simple language
 * allow for colour blind people by
    *  not using conflicting colours - particularly red/green or blue/orange
    *  not using colour as the sole indicator of importance (e.g. also have some numbered scale)
    *  choosing colours from a colourblind-friendly palette
 * avoid excessive use of animation
 * allow for sight impairment and use of screen readers by
    * using uncluttered backgrounds
    * appropriately sizing text, especially on images
    * adding ALT-TEXT behind diagrams and images (for presentations that will be available online)
    * adding a unique title for each slide
    * use sufficient contrast between text and background colours
 * use simple table structures with clear headings
 * use larger font sizes and sufficient white space
 * avoid adding too much content per slide or making slides busy
 * videos should be made accessible to visually-impaired and hearing-impaired persons
